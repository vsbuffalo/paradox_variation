  title    = "A simple expression for the strength of selection on
              recombination generated by interference among mutations",
  author   = "Roze, Denis",
  abstract = "One of the most widely cited hypotheses to explain the
              evolutionary maintenance of genetic recombination states that the
              reshuffling of genotypes at meiosis increases the efficiency of
              natural selection by reducing interference among selected loci.
              However, and despite several decades of theoretical work, a
              quantitative estimation of the possible selective advantage of a
              mutant allele increasing chromosomal map length (the average
              number of cross-overs at meiosis) remains difficult. This article
              derives a simple expression for the strength of selection acting
              on a modifier gene affecting the genetic map length of a whole
              chromosome or genome undergoing recurrent mutation. In
              particular, it shows that indirect selection for recombination
              caused by interference among mutations is proportional to
              [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is the effective
              population size, U is the deleterious mutation rate per
              chromosome, and R is the chromosome map length. Indirect
              selection is relatively insensitive to the fitness effects of
              deleterious alleles, epistasis, or the genetic architecture of
              recombination rate variation and may compensate for substantial
              costs associated with recombination when linkage is tight.
              However, its effect generally stays weak in large, highly
              recombining populations.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Humans have reduced the abundance of many large
              marine vertebrates, including whales, large fish, and sharks, to
              only a small percentage of their pre-exploitation levels.
              Industrial fishing and whaling also tended to preferentially
              harvest the largest species and largest individuals within a
              population. We consider the consequences of removing these
              animals on the ocean's ability to store carbon.
              METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Because body size is critical to
              our arguments, our analysis focuses on populations of baleen
              whales. Using reconstructions of pre-whaling and modern
              abundances, we consider the impact of whaling on the amount of
              carbon stored in living whales and on the amount of carbon
              exported to the deep sea by sinking whale carcasses. Populations
              of large baleen whales now store 9.1$\times$10(6) tons less
              carbon than before whaling. Some of the lost storage has been
              offset by increases in smaller competitors; however, due to the
              relative metabolic efficiency of larger organisms, a shift toward
              smaller animals could decrease the total community biomass by
              30\% or more. Because of their large size and few predators,
              whales and other large marine vertebrates can efficiently export
              carbon from the surface waters to the deep sea. We estimate that
              rebuilding whale populations would remove 1.6$\times$10(5) tons
              of carbon each year through sinking whale carcasses.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Even though fish and whales are only a
              small portion of the ocean's overall biomass, fishing and whaling
              have altered the ocean's ability to store and sequester carbon.
              Although these changes are small relative to the total ocean
              carbon sink, rebuilding populations of fish and whales would be
              comparable to other carbon management schemes, including ocean
              iron fertilization.",

              understanding of the evolutionary forces driving DNA sequence
              evolution. Island species usually have lower census population
              sizes (N) than continental species and, supposedly, lower
              effective population sizes (Ne). Given that both the rates of
              change caused by genetic drift and by selection are dependent
              upon Ne, island species are theoretically expected to exhibit (1)
              lower genetic diversity, (2) less effective natural selection
              against slightly deleterious mutations,3,4 and (3) a lower rate
              of adaptive evolution.5-8 Here, we have used a large set of newly
              sequenced and published whole-genome sequences of Passerida
              species (14 insular and 11 continental) to test these

              provide robust evidence that the lower Ne experienced by island
              species has affected both the ability of natural selection to
              efficiently remove weakly deleterious mutations and also the
              adaptive potential of island species, therefore providing

              mainly a collection of case studies, each with its own approach
              and specificities, such that a global view of the gradual process
              of evolution from one to two species is currently lacking. Of
              primary importance is the prevalence of gene flow between
              diverging entities, which is central in most species concepts and
              has been widely discussed in recent years. Here, we explore the
              continuum of speciation thanks to a comparative analysis of
              genomic data from 61 pairs of populations/species of animals with
              variable levels of divergence. Gene flow between diverging gene
              pools is assessed under an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)

              speciation, in which taxonomy is often controversial, spans from
              0.5\% to 2\% of net synonymous divergence, irrespective of

              barriers to gene flow) and highlights the intrinsic difficulty,

              similar average effects on linked neutral variability, if the
              product of the rate and strength of selection is held constant.
              We propose an approximate Bayesian (ABC) polymorphism-based
              estimator that can be used to distinguish between these models,
              and apply it to multi-locus data from Drosophila melanogaster. We
              investigate the extent to which inference about the strength of
              selection is sensitive to assumptions about the underlying
              distributions of the rates of substitution and recombination, the
              strength of selection, heterogeneity in mutation rate, as well as
              the population's demographic history. We show that assuming fixed

              important debates in medical and evolutionary genetics. Here, we
              present a method for inferring this distribution using Single
              Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from a population with
              non-stationary demographic history (such as that of modern
              humans). Application of our method to 47,576 coding SNPs found by
              direct resequencing of 11,404 protein coding-genes in 35
              individuals (20 European Americans and 15 African Americans)
              allows us to assess the relative contribution of demographic and
              selective effects to patterning amino acid variation in the human
              genome. We find evidence of an ancient population expansion in
              the sample with African ancestry and a relatively recent
              bottleneck in the sample with European ancestry. After accounting
              for these demographic effects, we find strong evidence for great
              variability in the selective effects of new amino acid replacing
              mutations. In both populations, the patterns of variation are
              consistent with a leptokurtic distribution of selection
              coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal) peaked near neutrality.
              Specifically, we predict 27-29\% of amino acid changing
              (nonsynonymous) mutations are neutral or nearly neutral (|s|1\%).
              Our results are consistent with 10-20\% of amino acid differences
              between humans and chimpanzees having been fixed by positive
              selection with the remainder of differences being neutral or
              nearly neutral. Our analysis also predicts that many of the
              alleles identified via whole-genome association mapping may be
              selectively neutral or (formerly) positively selected, implying
              that deleterious genetic variation affecting disease phenotype

              of natural selection, particularly positive natural selection, in
              shaping the human genome. Although scans for positive selection
              have identified candidate loci that may be associated with
              positive selection in humans, such scans do not indicate whether
              adaptation is frequent in general in humans. Studies based on the
              reasoning of the MacDonald-Kreitman test, which, in principle,
              can be used to evaluate the extent of positive selection,
              suggested that adaptation is detectable in the human genome but
              that it is less common than in Drosophila or Escherichia coli.
              Both positive and purifying natural selection at functional sites
              should affect levels and patterns of polymorphism at linked
              nonfunctional sites. Here, we search for these effects by
              analyzing patterns of neutral polymorphism in humans in relation
              to the rates of recombination, functional density, and functional
              divergence with chimpanzees. We find that the levels of neutral
              polymorphism are lower in the regions of lower recombination and
              in the regions of higher functional density or divergence. These
              correlations persist after controlling for the variation in GC
              content, density of simple repeats, selective constraint,
              mutation rate, and depth of sequencing coverage. We argue that
              these results are most plausibly explained by the effects of
              natural selection at functional sites -- either recurrent
              selective sweeps or background selection -- on the levels of
              linked neutral polymorphism. Natural selection at both coding and
              regulatory sites appears to affect linked neutral polymorphism,
              reducing neutral polymorphism by 6\% genome-wide and by 11\% in
              the gene-rich half of the human genome. These findings suggest
              that the effects of natural selection at linked sites cannot be

              of this genome reference sequence reveals interesting patterns of

              found in minimal introns. While this may be partly explained by a

              climatic change. Timescales in most phylogenetic studies use
              geologically dated fossils or phylogeographic events as
              calibration points, but more recently, it has also become
              possible to use experimentally derived estimates of the mutation
              rate as a proxy for substitution rates. The large radiation of
              drosophilid taxa endemic to the Hawaiian islands has provided
              multiple calibration points for the Drosophila phylogeny, thanks
              to the ``conveyor belt'' process by which this archipelago forms
              and is colonized by species. However, published date estimates
              for key nodes in the Drosophila phylogeny vary widely, and many
              are based on simplistic models of colonization and coalescence or
              on estimates of island age that are not current. In this study,
              we use new sequence data from seven species of Hawaiian
              Drosophila to examine a range of explicit coalescent models and
              estimate substitution rates. We use these rates, along with a
              published experimentally determined mutation rate, to date key
              events in drosophilid evolution. Surprisingly, our estimate for
              the date for the most recent common ancestor of the genus
              Drosophila based on mutation rate (25-40 Ma) is closer to being
              compatible with independent fossil-derived dates (20-50 Ma) than

              sensitive to model choice and give rise to point estimates that
              range between 26 and 192 Ma, depending on the details of the
              model. Potential problems with the Hawaiian calibration may arise
              from systematic variation in the molecular clock due to the long
              generation time of Hawaiian Drosophila compared with other
              Drosophila and/or uncertainty in linking island formation dates
              with colonization dates. As either source of error will bias

              neutral theory predicts that the amount of variation in the
              genome sequence between different individuals of the same species
              should increase with its effective population size (Ne). In real
              populations, multiple factors that modulate the variance in
              reproductive success among individuals cause Ne to differ from
              the total number of individuals (N). Among these, age-specific
              mortality and fecundity rates are known to have a direct impact
              on the Ne/N ratio. However, the extent to which vital rates
              account for differences in genetic diversity among species
              remains unknown. Here, we addressed this question by comparing
              genome-wide genetic diversity across 16 marine fish species with
              similar geographic distributions but contrasted lifespan and
              age-specific survivorship and fecundity curves. We sequenced the
              whole genome of 300 individuals to high coverage and assessed
              their genome-wide heterozygosity with a reference-free approach.
              Individual genome-wide heterozygosity varied from 0.2 to 1.4\%,
              and adult lifespan was by far the most significant predictor of
              genetic diversity, with a large negative effect (slope=-0.089 per
              additionnal year of lifespan) that was further increased when
              brooding species providing intense parental care were removed
              from the dataset (slope=-0.129 per additionnal year of lifespan).
              Using published vital rates for each species, we showed that the
              Ne/N ratio only generated by life tables predict the observed
              differences in genetic diversity among species. We further found
              that the extent of reduction in Ne/N with increasing adult
              lifespan is particularly strong under Type III survivorship
              curves (high juvenile and low adult mortality) and increasing
              fecundity with age, which is typical of marine fish. Our study

              Drosophila species, I uncover new patterns explicitly predicted
              by reinforcement. Broadly, I found that almost all sympatric
              species had concordant isolation asymmetries, where the more
              costly reciprocal mating has greater prezygotic isolation
              relative to the less costly mating. No such patterns exist in
              allopatry. Using simulations, I ruled out alternative
              explanations and showed that concordant isolation asymmetries in
              sympatry are likely unique signatures of reinforcement. These
              results allowed me to estimate that reinforcement may impact
              60-83\% of all sympatric Drosophila and enhance premating
              isolation by 18-26\%. These findings suggest that reinforcement
              plays a key role in Drosophila speciation.",

  abstract = "Variation among individuals in number of offspring (fitness, k)
              sets an upper limit to the evolutionary response to selection.
              This constraint is quantified by Crow's Opportunity for Selection
              (I), which is the variance in relative fitness (I = $\sigma$2k
              /(uk )2 ). Crow's I has been widely used but remains
              controversial because it depends on mean offspring number in a
              sample ( k \textasciimacron{} ). Here, I used a generalized
              Wright-Fisher model that allows for unequal probabilities of
              producing offspring to evaluate behavior of Crow's I and related
              indices under a wide range of sampling scenarios. Analytical and
              numerical results are congruent and show that rescaling the
              sample variance (s2k ) to its expected value at a fixed k
              \textasciimacron{} 2 removes dependence of I on mean offspring
              number, but the result still depends on choice of k
              \textasciimacron{} 2 . A new index is introduced, $\Delta$I =
              {\^I} - E({\^I}drift ) = {\^I} - 1/ k \textasciimacron{} , which
              makes {\^I} independent of sample k \textasciimacron{} without
              the need for variance rescaling. $\Delta$I has a straightforward
              interpretation as the component of variance in relative fitness
              that exceeds that expected under a null model of random
              reproductive success. $\Delta$I can be used to directly compare
              estimates of the Opportunity for Selection for samples from

              advanced, or the fittest ancestors have exceptionally large
              number of descendants, which Luria and Delbr{\"u}ck called
              ``jackpot'' events. Here, I show that recurrent jackpot events
              generate a deterministic median bias favoring majority alleles,
              which is akin to positive frequency-dependent selection
              (proportional to the log ratio of the frequencies of mutant and
              wild-type alleles). This fictitious selection force results from
              the fact that majority alleles tend to sample deeper into the
              tail of the descendant distribution. The flip side of this
              sampling effect is the rare occurrence of large frequency hikes
              in favor of minority alleles, which ensures that the allele
              frequency dynamics remains neutral in expectation, unless genuine
              selection is present. The resulting picture of a selection-like
              bias compensated by rare big jumps allows for an intuitive

              temporal changes in allele frequencies, they continue to be used
              routinely in this context. Because the null hypothesis stipulated
              by the test is violated if samples are temporally spaced, the
              true probability of a significant test statistic will not equal
              the nominal $\alpha$ level, and conclusions drawn on the basis of
              such tests can be misleading. A generalized method, applicable to
              a wide variety of organisms and sampling schemes, is developed
              here to estimate the probability of a significant test statistic
              if the only forces acting on allele frequencies are stochastic
              ones (i.e., sampling error and genetic drift). Results from
              analyses and simulations indicate that the rate at which this
              probability increases with time is determined primarily by the
              ratio of sample size to effective population size. Because this
              ratio differs considerably among species, the seriousness of the
              error in using the standard test will also differ. Bias is
              particularly strong in cases in which a high percentage of the
              total population can be sampled (for example, endangered
              species). The model used here is also applicable to the analysis
              of parent-offspring data and to comparisons of replicate samples
              from the same generation. A generalized test of the hypothesis
              that observed changes in allele frequency can be satisfactorily
              explained by drift follows directly from the model, and
              simulation results indicate that the true $\alpha$ level of this

              force that acts to reduce the genetic variation in evolving
              populations, yet rigorous arguments for this idea are scarce.
              When selection fluctuates in time, it is unclear whether
              frequency-independent selection may maintain genetic polymorphism
              without invoking additional mechanisms. We show that constant
              frequency-independent selection with arbitrary epistasis on a
              well-mixed haploid population eliminates genetic variation if we
              assume linkage equilibrium between alleles. To this end, we
              introduce the notion of frequency-independent selection at the
              level of alleles, which is sufficient to prove our claim and
              contains the notion of frequency-independent selection on
              haploids. When selection and recombination are weak but of the
              same order, there may be strong linkage disequilibrium; numerical
              calculations show that stable equilibria are highly unlikely.
              Using the example of a diallelic two-locus model, we then
              demonstrate that frequency-independent selection that fluctuates
              in time can maintain stable polymorphism if linkage
              disequilibrium changes its sign periodically. We put our findings
              in the context of results from the existing literature and point
              out those scenarios in which the possible role of

  abstract  = "[Although it is widely acknowledged that the gradual
               accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations is an important
               source of extinction for asexual populations, it is generally
               assumed that this process is of little relevance to sexual
               species. Here we present results, based on computer simulations
               and supported by analytical approximations, that indicate that
               mutation accumulation in small, random-mating monoecious
               populations can lead to mean extinction times less than a few
               hundred to a few thousand generations. Unlike the situation in
               obligate asexuals in which the mean time to extinction (t̄e)
               increases more slowly than linearly with the population carrying
               capacity (K), t̄e increases approximately exponentially with K
               in outcrossing sexual populations. The mean time to extinction
               for obligately selfing populations is shown to be equivalent to
               that for asexual populations of the same size, but with half the
               mutation rate and twice the mutational effect; this suggests
               that obligate selfing, like obligate asexuality, is inviable as
               a long-term reproductive strategy. Under all mating systems, the
               mean time to extinction increases relatively slowly with the
               logarithm of fecundity, and mutations with intermediate effects
               (similar to those observed empirically) cause the greatest risk
               of extinction. Because our analyses ignore sources of
               demographic and environmental stochasticity, which have
               synergistic effects that exacerbate the accumulation of
               deleterious mutations, our results should yield liberal upper
               bounds to the mean time to extinction caused by mutational
               degradation. Thus, deleterious mutation accumulation cannot be
               ruled out generally as a significant source of extinction
               vulnerability in small sexual populations or as a selective
               force influencing mating-system evolution.]",

              genetics are based on discrete, well-mixed populations. As a
              result, many methods of analyzing genetic data assume that
              samples are a random draw from a well-mixed population, but are
              applied to clustered samples from populations that are structured
              clinally over space. Here, we use simulations of populations
              living in continuous geography to study the impacts of dispersal
              and sampling strategy on population genetic summary statistics,
              demographic inference, and genome-wide association studies
              (GWAS). We find that most common summary statistics have
              distributions that differ substantially from those seen in
              well-mixed populations, especially when Wright's neighborhood
              size is < 100 and sampling is spatially clustered.
              ``Stepping-stone'' models reproduce some of these effects, but
              discretizing the landscape introduces artifacts that in some
              cases are exacerbated at higher resolutions. The combination of
              low dispersal and clustered sampling causes demographic inference
              from the site frequency spectrum to infer more turbulent
              demographic histories, but averaged results across multiple
              simulations revealed surprisingly little systematic bias. We also
              show that the combination of spatially autocorrelated
              environments and limited dispersal causes GWAS to identify
              spurious signals of genetic association with purely
              environmentally determined phenotypes, and that this bias is only
              partially corrected by regressing out principal components of
              ancestry. Last, we discuss the relevance of our simulation
              results for inference from genetic variation in real organisms.",

              similarity depends both on the hierarchical phylogenetic
              structure, and on the specific magnitude and types of
              evolutionary changes that accumulate during each generation. In
              this study, we show how models of microevolutionary change can be
              translated into the resulting macroevolutionary patterns. We
              illustrate how the structure of phenotypic covariances expected
              in interspecific measurements can be derived, and how this
              structure depends on the microevolutionary forces guiding
              phenotypic change at each generation. We then explore the
              covariance structure expected from several simple
              microevolutionary models of phenotypic evolution, including
              various combinations of random genetic drift, directional
              selection, stabilizing selection, and environmental change, as

              distance. This is different from the usual linear patterns of
              decrease assumed in most comparative and systematic methods.
              Nevertheless, linear patterns of decrease can result from many

              directional and fluctuating selection as well as modes of

              measure of phylogenetic correlation, lambda, introduced by Pagel
              (1999), that normally varies between 0 (phylogenetic
              independence) and 1 (species' traits covary in direct proportion
              to their shared evolutionary history). Simulations show lambda to
              be a statistically powerful index for measuring whether data
              exhibit phylogenetic dependence or not and whether it has low
              rates of Type I error. Moreover, lambda is robust to incomplete
              phylogenetic information, which demonstrates that even partial
              information on phylogeny will improve the accuracy of
              phylogenetic analyses. To assess whether traits generally show
              phylogenetic associations, we present a quantitative review of 26
              published phylogenetic comparative data sets. The data sets
              include 103 traits and were chosen from the ecological literature
              in which debate about the need for phylogenetic correction has
              been most acute. Eighty-eight percent of data sets contained at
              least one character that displayed significant phylogenetic
              dependence, and 60\% of characters overall (pooled across
              studies) showed significant evidence of phylogenetic association.
              In 16\% of tests, phylogenetic correlation could be neither
              supported nor rejected. However, most of these equivocal results
              were found in small phylogenies and probably reflect a lack of
              power. We suggest that the parameter lambda be routinely
              estimated when analyzing comparative data, since it can also be
              used simultaneously to adjust the phylogenetic correction in a

              similar genomic footprints are also expected under models of
              large reproductive skew, posing a serious problem when trying to
              make inference. Furthermore, current approaches consider only one
              of the two processes at a time, neglecting any genomic signal
              that could arise from their simultaneous effects, preventing the
              possibility of jointly inferring parameters relating to both
              offspring distribution and population history. Here, we develop
              an extended Moran model with exponential population growth, and
              demonstrate that the underlying ancestral process converges to a
              time-inhomogeneous psi-coalescent. However, by applying a
              nonlinear change of time scale-analogous to the Kingman
              coalescent-we find that the ancestral process can be rescaled to
              its time-homogeneous analog, allowing the process to be simulated
              quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, we derive analytical
              expressions for the expected site-frequency spectrum under the

              coalescent and growth parameters. By means of extensive
              simulation, we demonstrate that both can be estimated accurately
              from whole-genome data. In addition, not accounting for
              demography can lead to serious biases in the inferred coalescent
              model, with broad implications for genomic studies ranging from
              ecology to conservation biology. Finally, we use our method to
              analyze sequence data from Japanese sardine populations, and find
              evidence of high variation in individual reproductive success,
              but few signs of a recent demographic expansion.",

  abstract = "The processes leading up to species extinctions are typically
              characterized by prolonged declines in population size and
              geographic distribution, followed by a phase in which populations
              are very small and may be subject to intrinsic threats, including
              loss of genetic diversity and inbreeding. However, whether such
              genetic factors have had an impact on species prior to their
              extinction is unclear; examining this would require a detailed
              reconstruction of a species' demographic history as well as
              changes in genome-wide diversity leading up to its extinction.
              Here, we present high-quality complete genome sequences from two
              woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius). The first mammoth was
              sequenced at 17.1-fold coverage and dates to ∼4,300 years before
              present, representing one of the last surviving individuals on
              Wrangel Island. The second mammoth, sequenced at 11.2-fold
              coverage, was obtained from an ∼44,800-year-old specimen from the
              Late Pleistocene population in northeastern Siberia. The
              demographic trajectories inferred from the two genomes are
              qualitatively similar and reveal a population bottleneck during
              the Middle or Early Pleistocene, and a more recent severe decline
              in the ancestors of the Wrangel mammoth at the end of the last
              glaciation. A comparison of the two genomes shows that the
              Wrangel mammoth has a 20\% reduction in heterozygosity as well as
              a 28-fold increase in the fraction of the genome that comprises
              runs of homozygosity. We conclude that the population on Wrangel
              Island, which was the last surviving woolly mammoth population,
              was subject to reduced genetic diversity shortly before it became
              extinct.",

              inversely proportional to N e , the effective population size.
              The impact of drift on genome diversity and evolution is known to
              vary among species, but quantifying this effect is a difficult
              task. Here we assess the magnitude of variation in drift power
              among species of animals via its effect on the mutation load -
              which implies also inferring the distribution of fitness effects
              of deleterious mutations (DFE). To this aim, we analyze the
              non-synonymous (amino-acid changing) and synonymous (amino-acid
              conservative) allele frequency spectra in a large sample of
              metazoan species, with a focus on the primates vs. fruit flies
              contrast. We show that a Gamma model of the DFE is not suitable
              due to strong differences in estimated shape parameters among
              taxa, while adding a class of lethal mutations essentially solves
              the problem. Using the Gamma + lethal model and assuming that the
              mean deleterious effects of non-synonymous mutations is shared
              among species, we estimate that the power of drift varies by a
              factor of at least 500 between large-N e and small-N e species of
              animals, i.e., an order of magnitude more than the among-species

              size (Ne ) to census size (N) falls roughly in the range 0·1-0·5
              for most populations. In a number of marine species, however,
              genetic estimates of contemporary Ne /N are as much as 5-6 orders
              of magnitude lower. Although some mechanisms that could produce
              such tiny Ne /N ratios have been proposed, the subject remains
              controversial. This issue is important to resolve: if Ne /N can
              be 10-3 or smaller, marine fish populations that are quite large
              could be at genetic risk. Based on a recently-improved
              understanding of factors that influence Ne and Ne /N in species
              with overlapping generations, this paper evaluates conditions
              necessary to produce tiny Ne /N ratios in actual populations.
              These analyses show that although increased longevity, fecundity
              and variance in reproductive success that increase with age, and
              increased egg quality with age [the big old fat fecund female
              fish (BOFFFF) hypothesis] all reduce Ne /N, extreme scenarios are
              required to reduce Ne /N below about 0·01. Therefore, tiny Ne /N
              ratios require some version of Hedgecock's 'sweepstakes'
              hypothesis, whereby only a few families reproduce successfully.
              Simulations using common genetically-based estimators show that,
              when true Ne is very large ($\geq$106 ), a substantial fraction
              of point estimates of Ne /N can be 10-3 or smaller. These results
              mean that tiny, genetically-based point estimates of Ne /N in
              large marine populations are expected to be quite common, even
              when the true Ne /N ratio is 'normal' (∼0·1 or higher). Very
              large samples of individuals can reduce, but not eliminate, this
              problem. The simulation results also emphasize the importance of
              considering deviations from model assumptions (e.g. non-random
              sampling; weak selection or migration) that may be relatively
              small (and hence can generally be ignored when the signal is
              strong) but can lead to substantial biases when the drift signal
              is weak, as is likely for large marine populations. Empirical
              studies of this topic need to be able to distinguish between
              episodes of sweepstakes reproductive success that are ephemeral
              and lead to chaotic genetic patchiness, and those that are
              consistent enough across space and time to produce persistent
              evolutionary consequences.",

  abstract  = "Rapid phenotypic adaptation is often observed in natural
               populations and selection experiments. However, detecting the
               genome-wide impact of this selection is difficult since
               adaptation often proceeds from standing variation and selection
               on polygenic traits, both of which may leave faint genomic
               signals indistinguishable from a noisy background of genetic
               drift. One promising signal comes from the genome-wide
               covariance between allele frequency changes observable from
               temporal genomic data (e.g., evolve-and-resequence studies).
               These temporal covariances reflect how heritable fitness
               variation in the population leads changes in allele frequencies
               at one time point to be predictive of the changes at later time
               points, as alleles are indirectly selected due to remaining
               associations with selected alleles. Since genetic drift does not
               lead to temporal covariance, we can use these covariances to
               estimate what fraction of the variation in allele frequency
               change through time is driven by linked selection. Here, we
               reanalyze three selection experiments to quantify the effects of
               linked selection over short timescales using covariance among
               time points and across replicates. We estimate that at least 17
               to 37\% of allele frequency change is driven by selection in
               these experiments. Against this background of positive
               genome-wide temporal covariances, we also identify signals of
               negative temporal covariance corresponding to reversals in the
               direction of selection for a reasonable proportion of loci over
               the time course of a selection experiment. Overall, we find that
               in the three studies we analyzed, linked selection has a large
               impact on short-term allele frequency dynamics that is readily
               distinguishable from genetic drift.",

               population persistence, but there is a need for an assessment of
               their consistency and informative relevance. Here we review the
               body of empirical estimates of Ne for wild populations obtained
               with the temporal genetic method and published since Frankham's
               (1995) review. Theoretical considerations have identified
               important sources of bias for this analytical approach, and we
               use empirical data to investigate the extent of these biases. We
               find that particularly model selection and sampling require more
               attention in future studies. We report a median unbiased Ne
               estimate of 260 (among 83 studies) and find that this median
               estimate tends to be smaller for populations of conservation
               concern, which may therefore be more sensitive to genetic
               stochasticity. Furthermore, we report a median Ne/N ratio of
               0.14, and find that this ratio may actually be higher for small
               populations, suggesting changes in biological interactions at
               low population abundances. We confirm the role of gene flow in
               countering genetic stochasticity by finding that Ne correlates
               strongest with neutral genetic metrics when populations can be
               considered isolated. This underlines the importance of gene flow
               for the estimation of Ne, and of population connectivity for
               conservation in general. Reductions in contemporary gene flow
               due to ongoing habitat fragmentation will likely increase the

              link N(e) and N; of these, only 31\% (160 of 508) correctly

               related to population size, but this issue remains
               controversial. The hypothesis that genetic variation is related
               to population size leads to the following predictions: (1)
               genetic variation within species should be related to population
               size; (2) genetic variation within species should be related to
               island size; (3) genetic variation should be related to

              long-lived, and late-maturing, with highly fecund adults adapted
              to spatially and temporally fluctuating ocean environments.
              Adults typically produce millions of small eggs that develop
              rapidly, without parental care, into planktonic larval stages
              that suffer high early mortality (Type III survivorship). Yet,
              large marine populations generally have only fractions of the
              genetic diversity expected from their sheer abundance, and
              despite widely dispersing larvae and geographically weakly
              structured adult populations, often show chaotic genetic
              heterogeneity on small spatial scales. These paradoxical
              observations can be explained by the hypothesis of Sweepstakes
              Reproductive Success (SRS), which posits extremely large variance
              in individual reproductive success, owing to sweepstakes-like
              chances of matching reproductive activity with oceanographic

              development, settlement, and recruitment to the adult spawning
              population. The primary genetic consequence of SRS is reduction
              of Ne /N, the ratio of effective to actual population numbers, to
              a value usually much smaller than 0.01. Published nearly 30 yrs

              However, it also distorts genealogies relative to neutral
              expectations. A structured coalescent method has been used to
              describe this effect, and forms the basis for numerical methods

              the additional approximation that lineages may be treated

              over 5 years) to generate genetic and demographic estimates of Ne

               limit processes, each with a different scaled mutation

              demographic and evolutionary dynamics of wild populations,
              molecular genetics has led to fundamental changes in our
              understanding of marine ecology. In particular, genetic
              approaches have revolutionized our understanding in three areas:
              (i) most importantly, they have contributed to the discovery of
              extensive genetic population structure in many marine species,
              overturning the notion of large, essentially homogenous marine
              populations limiting local adaptation and speciation. (ii)
              Concomitant differences in ecologically important traits now
              indicate extensive adaptive differentiation and biocomplexity,
              potentially increasing the resilience to exploitation and
              disturbance. Evidence for rapid adaptive change in many
              populations underlies recent concerns about fisheries-induced
              evolution affecting life-history traits. (iii) A compilation of
              recent published research shows estimated effective population
              sizes that are 2?6 orders of magnitude smaller than census sizes,
              suggesting more complex recruitment dynamics in marine species
              than previously assumed. Studies on Atlantic cod are used to
              illustrate these paradigm shifts. In our synthesis, we emphasize
              the implications of these discoveries for marine ecology and
              evolution as well as the management and conservation of exploited
              marine fish populations. An important implication of genetic
              structuring and the potential for adaptive divergence is that
              locally adapted populations are unlikely to be replaced through
              immigration, with potentially detrimental consequences for the

               published allozyme data for 16 shellfish stocks and their wild
               progenitors. Estimates of Ne for these broodstocks are all less
               than 100, and 13 are less than 50. For eight stocks, estimated
               Ne agrees with records of breeding numbers (Nb), but in the
               remaining eight cases, Nb lies outside of the 95\% confidence
               interval for estimated Ne. Assumptions of the temporal method

               distribution of temporal variances at individual loci, the other

               depending on the genetic similarity of immigrants and the

               stocks of Kuruma shrimp appears to have inflated temporal
               change, reducing estimated Ne; on the other hand, additions of
               wild hard clams to a hatchery stock appear to have retarded
               temporal change, increasing estimated Ne. Four cases in which Nb

               explained by contamination among stocks propagated
               simultaneously in the same hatchery. Finally, comparison of
               captive broodstocks with contemporary samples from natural
               sources confounds genetic drift that has occurred in both
               lineages; genetic drift is not negligible in some natural
               populations, leading to uncertainty in some Ne estimates. For
               four cases in which Nb is much larger than estimated Ne,
               variance in reproductive success is proposed as the most likely
               explanation of loss of genetic diversity over time. The
               extremely high fecundities and variable fertilities of aquatic
               organisms must be taken into account in broodstock management,
               particularly if hatchery products are used to enhance natural
               populations. The temporal method, when correctly applied and
               interpreted, provides new insight into the genetics of
               aquaculture broodstock populations.",

              (Ne) and the number of adults in a population (N) is important
              for predicting genetic change in small populations. In
              general,Neis expected to be close toN/2, i.e. in the
              rangeN/4--3N/4, provided that the powerful effect of population
              bottlenecks on reducingNeis factored out (using the harmonic mean
              of N). However, some very low published estimates ofNe/N(<0·1)
              raise the possibility that other factors acting to reduceNehave
              been underestimated. Here one such factor, variation in female
              fecundity, is investigated. Its effect onNedepends on the
              standardized variance in fecundity (per breeding season), a
              measure that is generally independent of mean fecundity.
              Empirical estimates of this standardized variance from 16 animal
              studies yielded an average value of 0·44, and a maximum value
              less than 1·5. To investigate the effect of such values, three
              kinds of fecundity variation were modelled: random (seasonal);
              individual; and age-related. Fixed individual differences among
              females reduceNethe most. However, to reduceNetoN/10, the
              resulting standardized variance must usually be 10 or more.
              Random differences need to be even larger to achieve the same
              reduction. One possible mechanism, the random loss of whole
              families, requires very high family mortality (90\% or more). The
              third model, fecundity that increases linearly with age, is
              ineffective at causing a marked decrease inNe. Given the finding
              that very unusual conditions are required to reduceNebelowN/10,
              low estimates ofNe/Nneed to be examined critically: the lowest
              published ratio, for a natural population of oysters, was found
              to be questionable because of possible immigration into the

              macro) and variance (V(k)) of family size] are measured during
              early life stages. The method of Crow \& Morton (1955) for
              scaling demographic data collected at a juvenile stage to
              expected values at adulthood is extended to consider sequential
              episodes of random and family correlated survival. Results show
              the following: (i) The order in which the episodes of random and
              family-correlated survival occur does not affect N(e) or N(e)/N;
              (ii) If a population experiences an episode of family-correlated
              survival, N(e)/N scaled to its expected value in a population of
              constant size (k macro= 2) is simply the survival rate during the
              family-correlated stage. If multiple such stages occur, scaled
              N(e)/N is the product of the survivals during all
              family-correlated life stages; (iii) Under the assumption of
              random post-enumeration survival, adjusting the variance
              effective size to its expected value at k macro= 2 is equivalent
              to computing the inbreeding effective size at the earlier life
              stage. Application to experimental data for hatchery populations
              of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) indicates that nonrandom

              under many circumstances, Ne is close to N/2, where N is the
              number of adults. This is shown to be the case for both simple
              and highly polygynous mating systems. The random union of gametes
              (RUG) and monogamy are two simple systems previously used in
              estimating Ne , and here a third, lottery polygyny, is added.
              Lottery polygyny, in which all males compete equally for females,
              results in a lower Ne than either RUG or monogamy! Given
              nonoverlapping generations the reduction is 33\% for autosomal
              loci and 25\% for sex-linked loci. The highly polygynous mating

              either survival or recruitment of adults, and the potential for a
              sex-ratio bias to change Ne is much reduced given a survival
              bias. The number of juveniles present also has some influence: as

              most fundamental questions in science. Yet the answer to this
              question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the world's
              biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded
              direct quantification of global species richness, and because
              indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly
              controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic
              classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to
              phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and
              predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a
              taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated
              against well-known taxa, and when applied to all domains of life,
              it predicts ~8.7 million ($\pm$ 1.3 million SE) eukaryotic
              species globally, of which ~2.2 million ($\pm$ 0.18 million SE)

               did the Industrial Revolution--and the unprecedented economic
               growth that came with it--occur in eighteenth-century England,
               and not at some other time, or in some other place? Why didn't
               industrialization make the whole world rich--and why did it make
               large parts of the world even poorer? In A Farewell to Alms,
               Gregory Clark tackles these profound questions and suggests a
               new and provocative way in which culture--not exploitation,
               geography, or resources--explains the wealth, and the poverty,
               of nations. Countering the prevailing theory that the Industrial
               Revolution was sparked by the sudden development of stable
               political, legal, and economic institutions in
               seventeenth-century Europe, Clark shows that such institutions
               existed long before industrialization. He argues instead that
               these institutions gradually led to deep cultural changes by
               encouraging people to abandon hunter-gatherer
               instincts-violence, impatience, and economy of effort-and adopt
               economic habits-hard work, rationality, and education. The
               problem, Clark says, is that only societies that have long
               histories of settlement and security seem to develop the
               cultural characteristics and effective workforces that enable
               economic growth. For the many societies that have not enjoyed
               long periods of stability, industrialization has not been a
               blessing. Clark also dissects the notion, championed by Jared
               Diamond in Guns, Germs, and Steel, that natural endowments such
               as geography account for differences in the wealth of nations. A
               brilliant and sobering challenge to the idea that poor societies
               can be economically developed through outside intervention, A

              recombination, nor on individual alleles that are tightly linked
              to the chromosomal neighborhood. The resulting interference
              between linked alleles reduces the efficiency of selection and
              distorts patterns of genetic diversity. Inference of evolutionary
              history from diversity shaped by linked selection requires an
              understanding of these patterns. Here, we present a simple but
              powerful scaling analysis identifying the unit of selection as
              the genomic ``linkage block'' with a characteristic length, ,

               Though our empirical knowledge of the genetic mechanisms of
               plant domestication is still relatively limited, there exists a
               large body of theory that offers a host of hypotheses on the

               domestication. The first predicts an increase in recombination
               rate through domestication, while the second argues that
               recombination rate should serve as a preadaptation to
               domestication. This study makes use of data on chiasma
               frequencies available from almost a century of plant

               increase in recombination, and in rejecting the preadaptation
               hypothesis, they suggest directions for future research into the

              presence of signal in one or both traits to justify regression
              analysis using phylogenetic methods such as independent contrasts
              or phylogenetic generalized least squares. 2.?This is incorrect,
              because phylogenetic regression assumes that the residual error
              in the regression model (not in the original traits) is
              distributed according to a multivariate normal distribution with
              variances and covariances proportional to the historical

  abstract = "Selective sweeps are thought to play a significant role in
              shaping patterns of variability across genomes; accurate
              predictions of their effects are, therefore, important for
              understanding these patterns. A commonly used model of selective
              sweeps assumes that coalescent events that occur during a sweep
              can be neglected, leading to simple expressions for the effects
              of sweeps on pairwise nucleotide site diversities and site
              frequency spectra. It is shown here that there is a significant
              probability that a pair of alleles sampled at the end of a sweep
              coalesce during the sweep. In the case of a favorable mutation
              with intermediate dominance, this probability is approximately
              equal to 0.135 in the absence of recombination. Expressions are
              derived for the expected reductions in pairwise neutral
              diversities caused by both single and recurrent sweeps in the
              presence of within-sweep coalescence, although the effects of
              multiple recombination events during a sweep are only treated
              heuristically. The accuracies of the resulting expressions were
              checked against the results of simulations. For high ratios of
              the recombination rate to the selection coefficient, the
              approximation that neglects within-sweep coalescence can be
              inaccurate by several orders of magnitude. The selection model
              used here can be applied to favorable mutations with arbitrary
              dominance coefficients, to sex-linked loci with sex-specific
              selection coefficients, and to inbreeding populations. Using the
              results from this model, the expected differences in levels of
              variability on X chromosomes and autosomes under selection at
              linked sites are discussed, and compared with data on a

              is one of the fundamental ecological and evolutionary
              characteristics of a species, and a strong predictor of
              extinction risk. However, the measurement of range size remains a
              substantial challenge. Indeed, there is significant confusion in
              the literature as to how this should be done, particularly in the
              context of the distinction between the fundamentally different
              concepts of extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy
              (AOO), and the use of these quantities, including in assessments
              of the threat status of species. 2 Here we review the different
              approaches to determining the geographic distributions of
              species, the measurement of their range sizes, the relationships
              between the two, and other difficulties posed by range size
              measurement (especially those of range discontinuities when
              measuring EOO, and spatial scale when measuring AOO). 3 We argue
              that it is important to (i) distinguish the estimation of the
              distribution of a species from the measurement of its geographic
              range size; (ii) treat measures of EOO and AOO as serving
              different purposes, rather than regarding them as more or less
              accurate ways of measuring range size; and (iii) measure EOO
              including discontinuities in habitat or occupancy. 4 Synthesis
              and applications. With the availability and collation of
              extensive data sets on species occurrences, a rapidly increasing
              number of studies are investigating geographic range size, and
              particularly how various measures of range size predict
              macroecological patterns and inform assessments of the
              conservation status of species and areas. The distinction between
              EOO and AOO is becoming blurred in many contexts, but most
              particularly in that of threatened species assessments for Red
              Listing. Continued progress in these fields demands greater
              clarity in the meaning and derivation of measures of geographic
              range size. The two principal measures serve different purposes,

              life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants
              ($\approx$450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily
              terrestrial, whereas animals ($\approx$2 Gt C) are mainly marine,

              predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show
              that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher
              than marine biomass and estimate a total of $\approx$6 Gt C of
              marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our

              to date, this critical question remains unresolved. Here we
              clarify the precise information that can be extracted from extant

              underlies most existing methods of estimation. We prove that, for

              alternative diversification scenarios that are equally likely to
              have generated any given extant timetree. These `congruent'

              congruent diversification scenarios can exhibit markedly

  abstract = "The rate at which genomes adapt to environmental changes and the
              prevalence of adaptive processes in molecular evolution are two
              controversial issues in current evolutionary genetics. Previous
              attempts to quantify the genome-wide rate of adaptation through
              amino-acid substitution have revealed a surprising diversity of
              patterns, with some species (e.g. Drosophila) experiencing a very
              high adaptive rate, while other (e.g. humans) are dominated by
              nearly-neutral processes. It has been suggested that this
              discrepancy reflects between-species differences in effective
              population size. Published studies, however, were mainly focused
              on model organisms, and relied on disparate data sets and
              methodologies, so that an overview of the prevalence of adaptive
              protein evolution in nature is currently lacking. Here we extend
              existing estimators of the amino-acid adaptive rate by explicitly
              modelling the effect of favourable mutations on non-synonymous
              polymorphism patterns, and we apply these methods to a
              newly-built, homogeneous data set of 44 non-model animal species
              pairs. Data analysis uncovers a major contribution of adaptive
              evolution to the amino-acid substitution process across all major
              metazoan phyla-with the notable exception of humans and primates.
              The proportion of adaptive amino-acid substitution is found to be
              positively correlated to species effective population size. This
              relationship, however, appears to be primarily driven by a
              decreased rate of nearly-neutral amino-acid substitution because
              of more efficient purifying selection in large populations. Our
              results reveal that adaptive processes dominate the evolution of
              proteins in most animal species, but do not corroborate the
              hypothesis that adaptive substitutions accumulate at a faster
              rate in large populations. Implications regarding the factors

              can restrict molecular adaptation and affect patterns of
              polymorphism and divergence. In particular, we focus on
              synonymous-site mutations, considering the fate of novel variants
              in a two-locus model and the equilibrium effects of interference
              with multiple loci and reversible mutation. We find that weak
              selection Hill-Robertson (wsHR) interference can considerably
              reduce adaptation, e.g., codon bias, and, to a lesser extent,
              levels of polymorphism, particularly in regions of low

              grouping in the input trees support and conflict with each group
              in the supertree. We compare our supertree construction method to
              a previously published supertree construction method by assessing
              their performance on input trees used to construct the Open Tree
              of Life version 4, and find that our method increases the number
              of displayed input splits from 35,518 to 39,639 and decreases the
              number of conflicting input splits from 2,760 to 1,357. The new

              approximations of the underlying evolutionary relationships as

              these questions have started to be tackled in animals, they have
              not been addressed to the same extent in plants. Here, we
              estimated nucleotide diversity at synonymous, $\pi$S, and
              nonsynonymous sites, $\pi$N, and a measure of the efficacy of
              selection, the ratio $\pi$N/$\pi$S, in 34 animal and 28 plant
              species using full genome data. We then evaluated the

              speciation is difficult, because many evolutionary processes can
              impact levels of variation. Facilitated by the first
              chromosome-level assembly for the group, we use whole-genome
              sequencing and simulations to shed light on the processes that
              have shaped the genomic landscape during a radiation of

              diversity ($\pi$) and differentiation (FST) landscapes have
              emerged across the group. Variation in these landscapes was
              strongly predicted by the local density of functional elements
              and the recombination rate, suggesting that the landscapes have
              been shaped by widespread natural selection. Using the varying
              divergence times between pairs of taxa, we show that the
              correlations between FST and genome features arose almost
              immediately after a population split and have become stronger
              over time. Simulations of genomic landscape evolution suggest
              that background selection (BGS; i.e., selection against
              deleterious mutations) alone is too subtle to generate the
              observed patterns, but scenarios that involve positive selection
              and genetic incompatibilities are plausible alternative
              explanations. Finally, tests for introgression among these taxa

              recent publications that develop phylogenetic meta-analysis,
              either implicitly or explicitly, and show how they can be
              considered as quantitative genetic models. We highlight some of
              the difficulties with the proposed solutions, and demonstrate
              that standard quantitative genetic theory and software offer
              solutions. We also show how results from Bayesian quantitative
              genetics can be used to create efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo
              algorithms for phylogenetic mixed models, thereby extending their
              generality to non-Gaussian data. Of particular utility is the
              development of multinomial models for analysing the evolution of
              discrete traits, and the development of multi-trait models in
              which traits can follow different distributions. Meta-analyses

              related species tend to be similar to one another in a myriad
              different ways. In statistical terms, this means that traits
              measured on one species will not be independent of traits
              measured on others. Since their introduction in the 1980s,
              phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) have been framed as a
              solution to this problem. In this article, we argue that this way
              of thinking about PCMs is deeply misleading. Not only has this
              sowed widespread confusion in the literature about what PCMs are
              doing but has led us to develop methods that are susceptible to
              the very thing we sought to build defenses against-unreplicated
              evolutionary events. Through three Case Studies, we demonstrate
              that the susceptibility to singular events is indeed a recurring
              problem in comparative biology that links several seemingly
              unrelated controversies. In each Case Study, we propose a
              potential solution to the problem. While the details of our
              proposed solutions differ, they share a common theme: unifying
              hypothesis testing with data-driven approaches (which we term
              ``phylogenetic natural history'') to disentangle the impact of
              singular evolutionary events from that of the factors we are
              investigating. More broadly, we argue that our field has, at
              times, been sloppy when weighing evidence in support of causal
              hypotheses. We suggest that one way to refine our inferences is
              to re-imagine phylogenies as probabilistic graphical models;

              collected from species related by a phylogenetic tree.
              Phylogenetic signal is a measure of the statistical dependence
              among species' trait values due to their phylogenetic
              relationships. Although phylogenetic signal is a measure of
              pattern (statistical dependence), there has nonetheless been a
              widespread propensity in the literature to attribute this pattern
              to aspects of the evolutionary process or rate. This may be due,
              in part, to the perception that high evolutionary rate
              necessarily results in low phylogenetic signal; and, conversely,
              that low evolutionary rate or stabilizing selection results in
              high phylogenetic signal (due to the resulting high resemblance
              between related species). In this study, we use individual-based
              numerical simulations on stochastic phylogenetic trees to clarify
              the relationship between phylogenetic signal, rate, and
              evolutionary process. Under the simplest model for quantitative

              other circumstances, such as functional constraint, fluctuating

              the relationship between process, rate, and phylogenetic signal

               providing a balanced summary of the field that will be useful
               for biologists at advanced undergraduate level and above. These

               or between a phenotype and an environment, are frequently
               carried out by invalid statistical methods. Most regression,

               nonparametric methods, assume that the points are drawn
               independently from a common distribution. When species are taken
               from a branching phylogeny, they are manifestly nonindependent.
               Use of a statistical method that assumes independence will cause
               overstatement of the significance in hypothesis tests. Some
               illustrative examples of these phenomena have been given, and

  author   = "Weissman, Daniel B and Barton, Nicholas H",
  abstract = "In large populations, many beneficial mutations may be
              simultaneously available and may compete with one another,
              slowing adaptation. By finding the probability of fixation of a
              favorable allele in a simple model of a haploid sexual
              population, we find limits to the rate of adaptive substitution,
              $\Lambda$, that depend on simple parameter combinations. When
              variance in fitness is low and linkage is loose, the baseline
              rate of substitution is $\Lambda$₀ = 2NU , where N is the
              population size, U is the rate of beneficial mutations per
              genome, and is their mean selective advantage. Heritable variance
              v in log fitness due to unlinked loci reduces $\Lambda$ by e⁻⁴(v)
              under polygamy and e⁻⁸ (v) under monogamy. With a linear genetic
              map of length R Morgans, interference is yet stronger. We use a
              scaling argument to show that the density of adaptive
              substitutions depends on s, N, U, and R only through the baseline
              density: $\Lambda$/R = F ($\Lambda$₀/R). Under the approximation
              that the interference due to different sweeps adds up, we show
              that $\Lambda$/R ~($\Lambda$₀/R) / (1 +2$\Lambda$₉/R) , implying
              that interference prevents the rate of adaptive substitution from
              exceeding one per centimorgan per 200 generations. Simulations
              and numerical calculations confirm the scaling argument and
              confirm the additive approximation for $\Lambda$₀/R ~ 1; for
              higher $\Lambda$₀/R , the rate of adaptation grows above R/2, but
              only very slowly. We also consider the effect of sweeps on
              neutral diversity and show that, while even occasional sweeps can
              greatly reduce neutral diversity, this effect saturates as sweeps
              become more common-diversity can be maintained even in
              populations experiencing very strong interference. Our results
              indicate that for some organisms the rate of adaptive
              substitution may be primarily recombination-limited, depending
              only weakly on the mutation supply and the strength of selection.",

              population size on genetic draft. Remarkably, the rate of
              substitution of weakly selected advantageous mutations decreases
              with increasing population size, whereas that for deleterious
              mutations increases with population size. This dependency on
              population size is the opposite of that for genetic drift.
              Moreover, these rates are only weakly dependent on population
              size, again contrary to the strong dependency of drift-based
              dynamics. Four models of the strongly selected loci responsible

              weak dependency on population size, which implies that their

              Together, these results suggest that population size and binomial

              integrating current knowledge with an analysis of linkage map

              processes governing recombination rate variation and consider how
              these influence evolutionary processes. Genome-wide recombination
              rates (cM/Mb) can vary more than tenfold across eukaryotes, and
              there is large variation in the distribution of recombination

              hypothesis that natural selection is a weak or infrequent
              evolutionary force. However, many species, particularly
              pathogens, are under continuous pressure to adapt in response to
              changing environments. A statistical framework for inference from
              diversity data of such populations is currently lacking. Towards
              this goal, we explore the properties of genealogies in a model of
              continual adaptation in asexual populations. We show that

              footprint in adapting populations. The site frequency spectrum of

              peak at high frequencies, whereas Tajima's D becomes more and

              to understand the evolutionary processes that have shaped genetic
              variation in a single sample taken from a present-day population.
              However, genomic data collected over tens of generations in both
              natural and laboratory populations are increasingly used to find
              selected loci underpinning adaptation over these short
              timescales. Although these studies have been quite successful in
              detecting selection on large-effect loci, the fitness differences
              between individuals are often polygenic, such that selection
              leads to allele frequency changes that are difficult to
              distinguish from genetic drift. However, one promising signal
              comes from polygenic selection's effect on neutral sites that
              become stochastically associated with the genetic backgrounds
              that lead to fitness differences between individuals. Previous
              theoretical work has established that the random associations
              between a neutral allele and heritable fitness backgrounds act to
              reduce the effective population size experienced by this neutral
              allele. These associations perturb neutral allele frequency
              trajectories, creating autocovariance in the allele frequency
              changes across generations. Here, we show how temporal genomic
              data allow us to measure the temporal autocovariance in allele
              frequency changes and characterize the genome-wide impact of
              polygenic selection. We develop expressions for these temporal
              autocovariances, showing that their magnitude is determined by
              the level of additive genetic variation, recombination, and
              linkage disequilibria in a region. Furthermore, by using analytic
              expressions for the temporal variances and autocovariances in
              allele frequency, we demonstrate that one can estimate the
              additive genetic variation for fitness and the drift-effective
              population size from temporal genomic data. We also show how the
              proportion of total variation in allele frequency change due to
              linked selection can be estimated from temporal data. Overall, we
              demonstrate that temporal genomic data offer opportunities to
              identify the role of linked selection on genome-wide diversity
              over short timescales, and can help bridge population genetic and
              quantitative genetic studies of adaptation.",

              selection coefficients of beneficial amino acid mutations.
              Recurrent selective sweeps associated with adaptive substitutions
              should leave a characteristic signature in genome variability
              data that contains information about the frequency and strength
              of selection. Here, I document a significant negative correlation
              between the level and the frequency of synonymous site

              of weak effect on average, on the order of 10(-5) (i.e., 2N(e)s

              Consequently, we interpret these findings as evidence that
              natural selection shapes genome-wide patterns of neutral
              polymorphism in C. elegans. Our study provides the first
              demonstration of such an effect in a partially selfing animal.

              can each adequately describe the relationship between
              recombination rate and SNP density, but only when they
              incorporate selfing rate. Clarification of the relative roles of
              genetic hitchhiking and background selection in C. elegans awaits
              the development of specific theoretical predictions that account

              usually driven to extinction before genetic factors have time to
              impact them, but few studies have seriously addressed this issue.
              If this assertion is true, there will be little difference in
              genetic diversity between threatened and taxonomically related
              nonthreatened species. We compared average heterozygosities in
              170 threatened taxa with those in taxonomically related
              nonthreatened taxa in a comprehensive metaanalysis.
              Heterozygosity was lower in threatened taxa in 77\% of
              comparisons, a highly significant departure from the predictions
              of the no genetic impact hypothesis. Heterozygosity was on
              average 35\% lower (median 40\%) in threatened taxa than in
              related nonthreatened ones. These differences in heterozygosity
              indicate lowered evolutionary potential, compromised reproductive
              fitness, and elevated extinction risk in the wild. Independent
              evidence from stochastic computer projections has demonstrated

               This view is difficult to reconcile, however, with the
               observation that adaptation to anthropogenic changes, such as
               the introduction of pesticides, can occur very rapidly. Here we
               investigate adaptation at a key insecticide resistance locus
               (Ace) in Drosophila melanogaster and show that multiple simple
               and complex resistance alleles evolved quickly and repeatedly
               within individual populations. Our results imply that the
               current effective population size of modern D. melanogaster
               populations is likely to be substantially larger (> or =
               100-fold) than commonly believed. This discrepancy arises
               because estimates of the effective population size are generally
               derived from levels of standing variation and thus reveal
               long-term population dynamics dominated by sharp--even if
               infrequent--bottlenecks. The short-term effective population
               sizes relevant for strong adaptation, on the other hand, might
               be much closer to census population sizes. Adaptation in
               Drosophila may therefore not be limited by waiting for mutations
               at single sites, and complex adaptive alleles can be generated
               quickly without fixation of intermediate states. Adaptive events
               should also commonly involve the simultaneous rise in frequency
               of independently generated adaptive mutations. These so-called

              suggested that this correlation results from genetic hitchhiking
              associated with the fixation of strongly selected mutants. The
              hitchhiking process can be described as a series of two-step
              events. The first step consists of a strongly selected
              substitution wiping out linked variation in a population; this is
              followed by a recovery period in which polymorphism can build up
              via neutral mutations and random genetic drift. Genetic
              hitchhiking has previously been modeled as a steady-state process
              driven by recurring selected substitutions. We show here that the
              characteristic parameter of this steady-state model is alpha v,
              the product of selection intensity (alpha = 2Ns) and the
              frequency of beneficial mutations v (where N is population size
              and s is the selective advantage of the favored allele). We also
              demonstrate that the steady-state model describes the hitchhiking
              process adequately, unless the recombination rate is very low. To
              estimate alpha v, we use the data of DNA sequence variation from
              17 D. melanogaster loci from regions of intermediate to high
              recombination rates. We find that alpha v is likely to be > 1.3 x
              10(-8). Additional data are needed to estimate this parameter
              more precisely. The estimation of alpha v is important, as this

               survived. Their spatial effects depend on latitude and
               topography, with extensive extinction and recolonization in
               higher latitudes and altitudinal shifts and complex refugia
               nearer the tropics. The associated population dynamics varied
               with life history and geography, and the present genetic
               constitution of the populations and species carry attenuated
               signals of these past dynamics. Phylogeographic studies with DNA
               have burgeoned recently and studies are reviewed from the
               arctic, temperate and tropical regions, seeking commonalities of
               cause in the resulting genetic patterns. Arctic species show
               distinct shallow genetic clades with common geographical
               boundaries. Thus Beringia is distinct phylogeographically, but
               its role as a refugial source is complex. Arctic taxa do not
               show the common genetic pattern of southern richness and

               remain in a large population for a long period of time if it is
               maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious alleles, and
               hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population
               by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction
               below classical neutral values resulting from such background
               selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to
               fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity,
               and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to
               random-mating populations with no genetic recombination, and to
               populations reproducing exclusively asexually or by
               self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating
               system, the reduction is an exponential function of the total
               mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the

  abstract  = "Author Summary Often, a large species range will include patches
               where the species differs because it has adapted to locally
               differing conditions. For instance, rock pocket mice are often
               found with a coat color that matches the rocks they live in,
               these color differences are controlled genetically, and mice
               that don't match the local rock color are more likely to be
               eaten by predators. Sometimes, similar genetic changes have
               occurred independently in different patches, suggesting that
               there were few accessible ways to evolve the locally adaptive
               form. However, the genetic basis could also be shared if
               migrants carry the locally beneficial genotypes between nearby
               patches, despite being at a disadvantage between the patches. We
               use a mathematical model of random migration to determine how
               quickly adaptation is expected to occur through new mutation and
               through migration from other patches, and study in more detail
               what we would expect successful migrations between patches to
               look like. The results are useful for determining whether
               similar adaptations in different locations are likely to have
               the same genetic basis or not, and more generally in
               understanding how species adapt to patchy, heterogeneous

  abstract  = "Selection on one or more genes inevitably perturbs other genes,
               even when those genes have no direct effect on fitness. This
               article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking,
               concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and
               Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is
               due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with the
               apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness
               due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating selection is
               analysed which bridges these alternative treatments. When
               alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at a rate lambda, the
               rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 +
               E[1/pq]lambda/(2(2lambda + r))), where the recombination rate r
               is much smaller than the strength of selection. In spatially
               structured populations, the effects of any one substitution are
               weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency of a
               neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the rate of
               recombination relative to selection (r/s), and more weakly, on
               the neighbourhood size, Nb = 4(pi rho sigma)2. Spatial
               subdivision may allow local selective sweeps to occur more
               frequently than is indicated by the overall rate of molecular
               evolution. However, it seems unlikely that such sweeps can be
               sufficiently frequent to increase significantly the drift of
               neutral alleles.",

               to occur while a deleterious mutation-selection balance is
               present in a population. We analyze this interaction of
               directional selection and background selection and study their
               combined effects on neutral variation, using a three-locus model
               in which each locus is subjected to either deleterious,
               favorable, or neutral mutations. Average heterozygosity is
               measured by simulations ([1][1]) at the stationary state under
               the assumption of recurrent hitchhiking events and ([2][2]) as a
               transient level after a single hitchhiking event. The simulation

  abstract  = "The general theory of the effective size (Ne) for populations
               under directional selection is extended to cover linkage. Ne is
               a function of the association between neutral and selected genes
               generated by finite sampling. This association is reduced by
               three factors: the recombination rate, the reduction of genetic
               variance due to drift, and the reduction of genetic variance of
               the selected genes due to selection. If the genetic size of the
               genome (L in Morgans) is not extremely small the equation for Ne
               is [formula, see text] where N is the number of reproductive
               individuals, C 2 is the genetic variance for fitness scaled by
               the squared mean fitness, (1 - Z) = Vm/C2 is the rate of
               reduction of genetic variation per generation and Vm is the
               mutational input of genetic variation for fitness. The above
               predictive equation of Ne is valid for the infinitesimal model
               and for a model of detrimental mutations. The principles of the
               theory are also applicable to favorable mutation models if there
               is a continuous flux of advantageous mutations. The predictions
               are tested by simulation, and the connection with previous
               results is found and discussed. The reduction of effective size
               associated with a neutral mutation is progressive over
               generations until the asymptotic value (the above expression) is
               reached after a number of generations. The magnitude of the
               drift process is, therefore, smaller for recent neutral
               mutations than for old ones. This produces equilibrium values of
               average heterozygosity and proportion of segregating sites that
               cannot be formally predicted from the asymptotic Ne, but both
               parameters can still be predicted by following the drift along
               the lineage of genes. The spectrum of gene frequencies in a
               given generation can also be predicted by considering the
               overlapping of distributions corresponding to mutations that

               understand how natural selection influences DNA sequence
               variability. Yet while empirical studies have uncovered
               significant evidence for selection in many natural populations,
               a rigorous characterization of these selection pressures has so
               far been difficult to achieve. The problem is that when
               selection acts on linked loci, it introduces correlations along
               the genome that are difficult to disentangle. These
               ``interference'' effects have been extensively studied in
               simulation, but theory still struggles to account for
               interference in predicted patterns of sequence variability,
               which limits the quantitative conclusions that can be drawn from
               modern sequence data. Here, we show that in spite of this
               complexity, simple behavior emerges in the limit that
               interference is common. Patterns of molecular evolution depend
               on the variance in fitness within the population, and are only
               weakly influenced by the fitness effects of individual
               mutations. We leverage this ``emergent simplicity'' to establish
               a new framework for predicting genetic diversity in these
               populations. Our results have important practical implications
               for the interpretation of natural sequence variability,
               particularly in regions of low recombination, and suggest an

               that result in ecological character displacement; that is,
               divergence in resource-exploiting traits such as jaws and beaks.
               Nevertheless, the process of character displacement occurring in
               nature, from the initial encounter of competitors to the
               evolutionary change in one or more of them, has not previously
               been investigated. Here we report that a Darwin's finch species
               (Geospiza fortis) on an undisturbed Gal{\'a}pagos island
               diverged in beak size from a competitor species (G.
               magnirostris) 22 years after the competitor's arrival, when they
               jointly and severely depleted the food supply. The observed
               evolutionary response to natural selection was the strongest
               recorded in 33 years of study, and close to the value predicted
               from the high heritability of beak size. These findings support

               changes in precipitation may be particularly potent selective
               factors, especially in arid regions. Here we demonstrate the
               evolutionary response of an annual plant, Brassica rapa, to a
               recent climate fluctuation resulting in a multiyear drought.
               Ancestral (predrought) genotypes were recovered from stored seed
               and raised under a set of common environments with descendant
               (postdrought) genotypes and with ancestorxdescendant hybrids. As
               predicted, the abbreviated growing seasons caused by drought led
               to the evolution of earlier onset of flowering. Descendants
               bloomed earlier than ancestors, advancing first flowering by 1.9
               days in one study population and 8.6 days in another. The
               intermediate flowering time of ancestorxdescendant hybrids
               supports an additive genetic basis for divergence. Experiments
               confirmed that summer drought selected for early flowering, that
               flowering time was heritable, and that selection intensities in
               the field were more than sufficient to account for the observed
               evolutionary change. Natural selection for drought escape thus
               appears to have caused adaptive evolution in just a few

               genomic diversity are often predicated on a single newly arisen
               mutation sweeping rapidly to fixation. However, a population can
               also adapt to a new environment by multiple mutations of similar
               phenotypic effect that arise in parallel, at the same locus or
               different loci. These mutations can each quickly reach
               intermediate frequency, preventing any single one from rapidly
               sweeping to fixation globally, leading to a ``soft'' sweep in
               the population. Here we study various models of parallel
               mutation in a continuous, geographically spread population
               adapting to a global selection pressure. The slow geographic
               spread of a selected allele due to limited dispersal can allow
               other selected alleles to arise and start to spread elsewhere in
               the species range. When these different selected alleles meet,
               their spread can slow dramatically and so initially form a
               geographic patchwork, a random tessellation, which could be
               mistaken for a signal of local adaptation. This spatial
               tessellation will dissipate over time due to mixing by
               migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within the global
               population. We show that the spatial tessellation initially
               formed by mutational types is closely connected to Poisson
               process models of crystallization, which we extend. We find that
               the probability of parallel mutation and the spatial scale on
               which parallel mutation occurs are captured by a single compound
               parameter, a characteristic length, which reflects the expected
               distance a spreading allele travels before it encounters a
               different spreading allele. This characteristic length depends
               on the mutation rate, the dispersal parameter, the effective
               local density of individuals, and to a much lesser extent the
               strength of selection. While our knowledge of these parameters
               is poor, we argue that even in widely dispersing species, such
               parallel geographic sweeps may be surprisingly common. Thus, we
               predict that as more data become available, many more examples
               of intraspecies parallel adaptation will be uncovered.",

               variation at linked sites. Quantifying the effects of ``linked
               selection'' on levels of genetic diversity is key to making
               reliable inference about demography, building a null model in
               scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics
               of natural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that
               jointly infers parameters of distinct modes of linked selection,
               notably background selection and selective sweeps, from
               genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations and genetic
               maps. The central idea is to calculate the probability that a
               neutral site is polymorphic given local annotations,
               substitution patterns, and recombination rates. Information is
               then combined across sites and samples using composite
               likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of
               distinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter
               estimation, this approach yields a map of the expected neutral
               diversity levels along the genome. To illustrate the utility of
               our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing data from
               125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict
               diversity levels at the 1Mb scale. Our results corroborate
               estimates of a high fraction of beneficial substitutions in
               proteins and untranslated regions (UTR). They allow us to
               distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes
               of selection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover
               evidence for pervasive sweeps in untranslated regions (UTRs).
               Our inference further suggests a substantial effect of other
               modes of linked selection and of adaptation in particular. More
               generally, we demonstrate that linked selection has had a larger

               treatments of this method have adopted rather limiting

               is generally applicable to a wide variety of organisms. Use of a

  abstract  = "The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that the
               amount of neutral polymorphisms within a species will increase
               proportionally with the census population size (Nc). However,
               this prediction has not been borne out in practice: while the
               range of Nc spans many orders of magnitude, levels of genetic
               diversity within species fall in a comparatively narrow range.
               Although theoretical arguments have invoked the increased
               efficacy of natural selection in larger populations to explain
               this discrepancy, few direct empirical tests of this hypothesis
               have been conducted. In this work, we provide a direct test of
               this hypothesis using population genomic data from a wide range
               of taxonomically diverse species. To do this, we relied on the
               fact that the impact of natural selection on linked neutral
               diversity depends on the local recombinational environment. In
               regions of relatively low recombination, selected variants
               affect more neutral sites through linkage, and the resulting
               correlation between recombination and polymorphism allows a
               quantitative assessment of the magnitude of the impact of
               selection on linked neutral diversity. By comparing whole genome
               polymorphism data and genetic maps using a coalescent modeling
               framework, we estimate the degree to which natural selection
               reduces linked neutral diversity for 40 species of obligately
               sexual eukaryotes. We then show that the magnitude of the impact
               of natural selection is positively correlated with Nc, based on
               body size and species range as proxies for census population
               size. These results demonstrate that natural selection removes
               more variation at linked neutral sites in species with large Nc
               than those with small Nc and provides direct empirical evidence
               that natural selection constrains levels of neutral genetic
               diversity across many species. This implies that natural
               selection may provide an explanation for this longstanding

  abstract  = "Two major sources of stochasticity in the dynamics of neutral
               alleles result from resampling of finite populations (genetic
               drift) and the random genetic background of nearby selected
               alleles on which the neutral alleles are found (linked
               selection). There is now good evidence that linked selection
               plays an important role in shaping polymorphism levels in a
               number of species. One of the best-investigated models of linked
               selection is the recurrent full-sweep model, in which newly
               arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of
               selected alleles that sweep into the population may not be
               destined for rapid fixation. Here we develop a general model of
               recurrent selective sweeps in a coalescent framework, one that
               generalizes the recurrent full-sweep model to the case where
               selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a
               large population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected
               allele affects the genealogy at partially linked sites, which
               under fairly general assumptions are unaffected by the
               subsequent fate of the selected allele. We also apply the theory
               to a simple model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial
               sweeps on levels of neutral diversity and find that for a given
               reduction in diversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps
               on the frequency spectrum at neutral sites is determined
               primarily by the frequencies rapidly achieved by the selected
               alleles. Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to
               low frequencies can have a profound effect on levels of
               diversity but can leave the frequency spectrum relatively
               unperturbed. In fact, the limiting coalescent model under a high
               rate of sweeps to low frequency is identical to the standard
               neutral model. The general model of selective sweeps we describe
               goes some way toward providing a more flexible framework to
               describe genomic patterns of diversity than is currently
               available.",

               probability of an allele that can find itself in a variety of
               genetic backgrounds is applied to find the effect of
               substitutions, fluctuating polymorphisms, and deleterious
               mutations in a large population. With loose linkage, r, the
               effects depend on the additive genetic variance in relative
               fitness, var(W), and act by reducing effective population size
               by (N/Ne) = 1 + var(W)/2r2. However, tightly linked loci can
               have a substantial effect not predictable from Ne. Linked
               deleterious mutations reduce the fixation probability of weakly
               favored alleles by exp (-2U/R), where U is the total mutation

               an organism's biotic environment tends to be 'contrary',
               consistently evolving to the detriment of the organism; sex and
               recombination result in progeny genetically distinct from their
