## 1st Check Notes

In addition to the manual terrestriality / alphas in `species_range_fixes.r`,
here are some notes: 

 - Lates calcarifer is catadromous, but I've listed it as terrestrial.

 - Oncorhynchus is anadramous and are listed as terrestrial

 - Sciaenops ocellatus -- TODO

 - Strongylocentrotus purpuratus -- CHECK

 Most Drosophilids are wrong.

 ## 2nd Check Notes

 - With default alpha, Nasonia vitripennis had an inferred area of 24079 km^2.
   This is far smaller than this indicates:
   http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bio/labs/WerrenLab/WerrenLab-NasoniaDistribution.html
   and https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy2009160 This species is broadly
   cosmopolitan but occurrences are low in the GBIF data. As a conservative
   estimate, I added the areas of US and Central Europe.


## Manually Assigned ranges

- Caenorhabditis -- this one's hard. Looking [this
  map](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bies.201500053?), and
  [this article](https://elifesciences.org/articles/05849), it seems a
  conservative range estimate is North America and Europe for C. elegans. It
  seems C. elegans hasn't been found in Asia, South America, or Africa.


## Marked as Missing

I marked some inferred ranges as missing, as the number off occurrences was too
low to make a quality range estimate. These are generally microorganisms often
not logged.

 - Chlamydomonas
 - Plasmodium
 - Neurospora
 - Phytophthora
