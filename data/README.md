# Data files

See the Makefile for more information in how things are processed.

## My Size Data

I manually input sizes with sources across two datasets: Leffler et al (2012)
and Stapley et al (2017). I did not duplicate entries; e.g. species in one do
not necessarily have entries in the other -- they need to be joined.

 - `stapley_et_al_2017.csv`
 - `leffler_et_al_2012.tsv`

## Drosophila Range Data

Drosophila GBIF occurrence data was poor quality for many species. I found some
old range maps and an Excel spreadsheet.

- `RAW_dataset_Jan_06_2012.xls`: this was downloaded from the WayBack Machine's
  archive of
  https://web.archive.org/web/20170710053101/http://www.drosophila-speciation-patterns.com/data/RAW_dataset_Jan_06_2012.xlsx

## Leffler et al (2012) data 

- `leffler_et_al_2012.tsv`: This is `Dataset_S1.txt` from [the article's
  supplementary
  material](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001388#s9),
  except I have manually added in the body size data. 

## Stapley et al (2017) data

- `stapley_et_al_2017.csv`: this is from the PDF supplementary material of
  [this
  paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2016.0455?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed).
  I manually extracted the data from the PDF, but after I was done Dr. Jessica
  Stapley provided me with a text version which I checked my values against.
  This also has body size information that I have manually researched and
  input.

## Corbet-Detig et al (2015) data

- `journal.pbio.1002112.s016.XLS`: map lengths
- `journal.pbio.1002112.s017.XLS`: selfing data
- `journal.pbio.1002112.s018.XLS`: genome size 
- `S2_Data.xls`: diversity data


## Romiguier et al (2014) data

- `romiguier_et_al_2014_supptable_2.xls` is [Supplementary Table 2 from this
  paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13685#Sec18).
